Once upon a time, in a village at the edge of a great forest, there lived a young girl named Elara. She loved to wander the woods and listen to the birds. One day she found a small silver key half-buried under an oak tree.

Elara took the key home and showed it to her grandmother. "This key," said her grandmother, "opens a door that appears only when the moon is full. But beware—what lies behind it can grant one wish, and one wish only."

When the full moon came, Elara walked back into the forest. Sure enough, a door stood in the clearing where the oak grew. She turned the key and stepped through.

On the other side was a garden of glowing flowers and a single fountain. A voice spoke: "Speak your wish, child." Elara thought of her village, where the river had run dry. "I wish for the river to flow again," she said. The voice replied, "So it shall be." The door closed behind her, and when she reached the village, the river was full of clear water. The key had vanished from her hand, but she never forgot that some doors open only once, and the best wish is the one that helps everyone.
